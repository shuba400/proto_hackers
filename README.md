# Proto Hacker Challenge

Mostly getting some practice on working with network packets (tcp/udp) and using go as primary language since it enough abstracted to not get lost in pointers/memory allocation, but also does exposes network APIs to get good grasp over internal working

## Submission
I am using gcs free tier and e2 vm instance with firewall rules to allow tcp/udp request. I will write a blog soon on how you can also host your own server in this vm instance.
